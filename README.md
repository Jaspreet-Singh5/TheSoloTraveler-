About the Project:	

The project is a website named, "TheSoloTraveler", which is basically travel
domain website which provides an easy-to-use user interface for searching and
booking hotels as well as provide reviews on the some rarely discussed yet
crucial components of a destination.

The website uses the API's provided by Google Inc.

=================================================================================

Environment :

The website has been built using Node.JS and uses MongoDB and Express.JS. 

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes
JavaScript code outside of a browser.

JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript
are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by  a JavaScript engine in the user's web
browser.

PROBLEM IN FOCUS :

When ever we travel for leisure, we find it very difficult to estimate our expenses and work
within our budget, we have no other choice but to travel in a package, which we cannot know 
for sure is worth the money.

We want integrate a place where the user can look at the average expenses for basic amminities 
and products at their desired location. These prices will be updated by users who feed in their 
reviews.

API's Used

Google API
